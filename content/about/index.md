I am a second-year Master's student in physics and astronomy in the Queen's University High Energy and Astroparticle Theory group (QHEAT). My research interests centre around dark matter theory and phenomenology. The [main part of my website](https://physics.yilda.ca) is about that.

This offshoot corner is so that I can list the novels I read. There are already dedicated websites for that, but in order to make the most use of my domain name purchase, I figured I would do it here too.

Reading is my biggest hobby, but I also enjoy learning languages and learning how to paint!
